## Fork of TensorFlowSharp with a example running on iOS

The example is present in Examples/FastStyleTransferIOS.

Before you run anything you need to download two files protobuf.a and libtensorflow-core.a and move them
to TensorFlowSharp/TensorFlowSharp.iOS folder. They are the two tensorflow compiled static libraries for iOS.

Note: To compile the static libraries yourself check my other fork of tensorflow itself.
